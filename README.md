# Inventory-Management-System
This project describes the Inventory Management System sufficiently to determine the
feasibility and usability of a finished system. The core concept is to track the sale of items from
the cash register with additional feature for interpreting the data. This software is to be a
standalone executable which provides an interface to an inventory database. ABC analysis and
age scheduling is implemented in the project. The program is easy to use, so that users can
easily add and remove inventory as necessary. To make the system more usable a billing system
has been included in the system so as to facilitate the owner to generate bills and print out
receipts for the customer. The owner can maintain the customer database so as to help all the
customers be updated with the offers or other promotional schemes the owner launches. The
updating of the inventory item database is done concurrently with the generation and
cancellation of each bill thus maintaining the accurate number of each inventory item. The
inventory also facilitates the changing of the login credentials by the owner itself securely. This
helps the owner prevent unauthorised actions and thus enables the safety of the data in the
system. The system helps calculate the reorder points for each inventory item thus letting the
owner know when to reorder the items from the vendor and replenish the inventory. The system
also does graphical processing of the data and gives the user the output in the form of the
graphical displays like pie-charts, bar graphs etc. Overall the complete development of this
software was to serve the sole purpose of easy analysis and management of the inventory along
with security of the data.
